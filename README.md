## Built With

### Major languages

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Frameworks

 - React
### Technologies used:
- npm
- Webpack
- Redux

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node
- npm

### Set up:

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andres-condezo/hello-react-front-end.git
cd hello-react-front-end 
```

### Install:

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage:

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\

-Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view
it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes
the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the
hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)
for more information.

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`,
you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and
configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
This command will remove the single build dependency
from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and
the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint,
etc) right into your project so you have full control
over them. All of the commands except `eject` will
still work, but they will point to the copied scripts
so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your
own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature
set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and
you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.
However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful
if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
